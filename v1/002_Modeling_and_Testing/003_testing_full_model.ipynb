      "<ABSTRACT> The electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique was applied to coat carbon and stainless steel fibres with alumina and titania nanoparticles, respectively. Non-aqueous colloidal suspensions suitable for EPD experiments were prepared by mixing ultrasonically a given amount of the ceramic particles in ethanol. After ultrasonic mixing, the suspensions were clear and stable and, therefore, suitable for the EPD experiments. The EPD parameters, e.g. voltage between electrodes, deposition time and pH of the suspensions, as well as the drying conditions were optimised in order to obtain crack-free, high-quality ceramic coatings on individual fibres. The coated fibres are intended as reinforcing elements for the fabrication of ceramic composites and as oxidation resistant fibrous bodies for applications in filters and membranes.\n",

      "<ABSTRACT> Reinvestigation of the flow pyrolysis of 1,1,2,2-tetramethyl-1,2-disilacyclohex-4-ene did not identify conditions under which the retro-Diels Alder reaction was the exclusive process. Extrusion of Me2Si=SiMe2was confirmed, but dimerization of directly extruded Me2Si: contributes significantly to its formation. Rearrangement of 1,1,2,2-tetramethyl-1,2-disilacyclohex-4-ene to 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-1,3-disilacyclohex-4-ene is a major process under a variety of conditions. Computational studies reduced the number of viable pathways. Both experimental and computational results point to stepwise extrusion of Me2Si=SiMe2 via a diradical intermediate and to linkage by one or more common intermediates of the extrusion pathway and the pathway leading to rearranged disilacyclohexene. Such a mechanism receives support from the formation of 1,2- and 1,3-disilacyclohex-4-enes, that is both the Diels-Alder product and the rearrangement product, in the addition of Me2Si=SiMe2 to butadiene.\n",

      "<ABSTRACT> Dogs and cats are hosts to hookworms that may cause zoonotic disease, most notably, cutaneous larva migrans. Ancylostoma braziliense is most often implicated in dermatological lesions, and Ancylostoma caninum has been associated with eosinophilic enteritis and suggested as a possible cause of diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis in humans. Other manifestations include eosinophilic pneumonitis, localized myositis, folliculitis, erythema multiforme, or ophthalmological manifestations. Ancylostoma eggs are morphologically indistinguishable, which complicates epidemiological studies. Surveys of dermatologists, gastroenterologists, and ophthalmologists would help to define the incidence of these zoonotic infections. Improved diagnostic tests are needed to identify the causative species involved and understand the epidemiology of hookworm disease.

Such increases often accompany infections with helminths and arthropods. The numbers in the peripheral blood will also often increase in allergic reactions. inflammation of hair follicles This is a genus of flies, called botflies, which lay eggs on the hairs of horses (and a few other animals). The adults are free living, but the larvae, the maggots, live and develop only in the stomach of the horse. These are small nematode parasites of the intestinal tract of vertebrates; hookworms suck blood to various degrees, depending on the species. They are called hookworms because the anterior end is bent backwards giving the worm a ‘hooked’ appearance. Infection with maggots. The term maggot is typically reserved for the larvae of flies, more specifically dipteran flies lacking a distinct head capsule. Apart from the Gasterophilus mentioned in the text, other genera of maggots such as Hypoderma of cattle have also been responsible for serpiginous track lesions in the skin of people. Inflammation of the muscle. Small, solid nodule in the skin, which may be intensely pruritic. This is a host in which a parasite can persist, without major developmental change, but which is not required for the life cycle to be completed. In the case of A. caninum, the larvae can infect and persist in cockroaches. They can also persist in the muscles of small rodents following infection by skin penetration, ingestion of larvae from soil, or by eating a cockroach. Dogs can get infected by ingesting larvae on grass, the skin penetration of larvae, or the ingestion of either the cockroach or mouse paratenic hosts. an unpleasant sensation that induces someone to scratch or rub the skin Transmission via the milk/mammary gland. Puppies become infected with the larvae of A. caninum while nursing. Some percentages of larvae that enter a dog persist in the dog's muscles.

      "<TITLE> Novel characteristics of a misprocessed mutant HERG channel linked to hereditary long QT syndrome\n",
      "<ABSTRACT> Hereditary long QT syndrome (hLQTS) is a heterogeneous genetic disease characterized by prolonged QT interval in the electrocardiogram, recurrent syncope, and sudden cardiac death. Mutations in the cardiac potassium channel HERG ( KCNH2) are the second most common form of hLQTS and reduce the delayed rectifier K + currents, thereby prolonging repolarization. We studied a novel COOH-terminal missense mutation, HERG R752W, which segregated with the disease in a family of 101 genotyped individuals. When the mutant cRNA was expressed in Xenopus oocytes it produced enhanced rather than reduced currents. Simulations using the Luo-Rudy model predicted minimal shortening rather than prolongation of the cardiac action potential. Consequently, a normal or shortened QT interval would be expected in contrast to the long QT observed clinically. This anomaly was resolved by our observation that the mutant protein was not delivered to the plasma membrane of mammalian cells but was retained intracellularly. We found that this trafficking defect was corrected at lower incubation temperatures and that functional channels were now delivered to the plasma membrane. However, trafficking could not be restored by chemical chaperones or E-4031, a specific blocker of HERG channels. Therefore, HERG R752W represents a new class of trafficking mutants in hLQTS. The occurrence of different classes of misprocessed channels suggests that a unified therapeutic approach for altering HERG trafficking will not be possible and that different treatment modalities will have to be matched to the different classes of trafficking mutants.\n",

      "<TITLE> Prospects for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines in Africa\n",
      "<ABSTRACT> The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a global pandemic, prompting unprecedented efforts to contain the virus. Many developed countries have implemented widespread testing and have rapidly mobilized research programmes to develop vaccines and therapeutics. However, these approaches may be impractical in Africa, where the infrastructure for testing is poorly developed and owing to the limited manufacturing capacity to produce pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, a large burden of HIV-1 and tuberculosis in Africa could exacerbate the severity of infection and may affect vaccine immunogenicity. This Review discusses global efforts to develop diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, with these considerations in mind. We also highlight vaccine and diagnostic production platforms that are being developed in Africa and that could be translated into clinical development through appropriate partnerships for manufacture. The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted unparalleled progress in the development of vaccines and therapeutics in many countries, but it has also highlighted the vulnerability of resource-limited countries in Africa. Margolin and colleagues review global efforts to develop SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, with a focus on the opportunities and challenges in Africa.\n",

      "<ABSTRACT> The prediction of SGPA and CGPA is beneficial to university students. Students will easily get an estimate of their final outcome from this project. As a result, the students will be able to brace themselves for a successful outcome. Students pass the day by participating in a variety of events. Students use social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. They engage in various hobbies such as playing mobile games, listening to music, among others. As a result, they were able to move several times with these tasks. As a result, if a student spends so much time doing any of those things, she will not be able to achieve a successful grade because of the experiment; students can develop a research routine or guideline that they can apply to their other tasks. Additionally, students' behaviors will forecast their outcomes. The Authors will now see machine learning in Python being used all over the place. After that, The Authors created a smart SGPA and CGPA prediction project, as well as the results on students. The findings are predicted using the Nave Byes algorithm. The Nave Byes algorithm is a simple but effective prediction algorithm. It is a machine learning algorithm as well. As a result, students will be given an estimate of their final exam scores. They can prepare them to make a good result by following the routine of the SGPA & CGPA prediction project.\n",

      "<ABSTRACT> Surface wave (SW) over-the-horizon (OTH) radars are not only widely used for ocean remote sensing, but they can also be exploited in integrated maritime surveillance systems. This paper represents the first part of the description of the statistical and spectral analysis performed on sea backscattered signals recorded by the oceanographic WEllen RAdar (WERA) system. Data were collected on May 13th 2008 in the Bay of Brest, France. The data statistical analysis, after beamforming, shows that for near range cells the signal amplitude fits well the Rayleigh distribution, while for far cells the data show a more pronounced heavy-tailed behavior. The causes can be traced in man-made (i.e. radio communications) and/or natural (i.e. reflections of the transmitted signal through the ionosphere layers, meteor trails) interferences.\n",

      "<TITLE> Placing the Rural in Regional Development\n",
      "<ABSTRACT> Ward N. and Brown D. L. Placing the rural in regional development, Regional Studies. Urban and regional development studies tend to focus on the urban as driving innovation and growth, with surrounding areas cast in a passive, residual role. As a result, rural and urban development debates are often conducted separately. This paper introduces a special issue on rural development. It sets out current rural development thinking in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, and explores two trends affecting the place of rural areas in regional development – the differentiation of ruralities in the context of global changes and the changing nature of travel and communications – or mobilities. It then introduces the papers in the special issue. Ward N. et Brown D. L. Introduire l'espace rural dans l'aménagement du territoire, Regional Studies. Les études de l'aménagement du territoire ont tendance à focaliser l'espace urbain comme moteur de l'innovation et de la croissance, tandis que les zones environnantes jouent un rôle plutôt passif et résiduel. Par la suite, les débats sur l'aménagement rural et le développement urbain sont souvent organisés séparément. Cet article cherche à introduire un numéro spécial sur l'aménagement rural. On présente ici la tendance actuelle de l'opinion sur l'aménagement rural dans les pays membres de l'Organisation de Coopération et de Développement Economique (OCDE), et examine deux tendances qui influencent le rôle des zones rurales dans l'aménagement du terrotioire – à savoir, la différenciation des zones rurales dans le cadre des changements mondiaux et le développement du transport et des communications – ou des déplacements. Ensuite on présente les articles dans le numéro spécial.

      "<TITLE> An Experimental Investigation of the Effects of Clamped Length and Loading Direction on Self-Loosening of Bolted Joints\n",
      "<ABSTRACT> An experimental investigation was conducted to study the effects of clamped length and loading direction on the self-loosening behavior of bolted joints by using specially designed fixtures. The experiments mimicked two plates jointed by an M12×1.75 class 10.9 bolt and a nut. The joints were subjected to cyclic external loading. A constant preload of 25kN was used for all the experiments conducted. During an experiment, the relative displacement between the two clamped plates, δ, was a controlling parameter. The reduction in clamping force, the applied transverse load, and the nut rotation were measured cycle by cycle. The relationship between, Δδ∕2, the amplitude of the relative displacement between the two clamped plates, and, NL, the number of loading cycles to loosening is referred to as self-loosening curve and was obtained for different clamped lengths and applied load directions. Similar to a fatigue curve, an endurance limit can be identified from the self-loosening curve. It was found that increasing the clamped length can enhance the self-loosening endurance limits in terms of the controlled relative displacement of the two clamped plates. However, the load carrying capability was not influenced significantly due to the thickness of the clamped plates. For a given bolted jointed structure, an angle of the external load from the pure shearing direction resulted in an increase in self-loosening resistance.\n",

      "<TITLE> Reproducibility of visual assessment on mammographic density\n",
      "<ABSTRACT> High mammographic density was an independent risk factor for breast cancer and has a higher associated risk than most other known risk factors. The reproducibility remains a major issue in assessment of breast parenchymal patterns. Misclassification of mammographic pattern can lead to significant underestimation of risk estimates. The purpose of this study was to assess the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability based on visual subjective mammographic density measurements. Three density measures, Wolfe parenchymal pattern, Boyd classification scale, and a percentage of densities in total breast, were investigated. The study included 101 women who were participants of the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study I (IBIS I) for up to 7 years. Seven sets of mammograms were collected for each woman. Left breast mediolateral oblique films were digitized, and the scanned images were independently reviewed by two readers. These images were reassessed by one reader after a year. The agreements of measures were evaluated by Kappa statistics (Wolfe and Boyd scale) and intraclass correlation coefficient (percentage densities). For the inter-rater agreement, Weighted Kappa for Wolfe scale was 0.89 (P < 0.0001) and for Boyd scale was 0.84 (P < 0.0001). The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.94 for percentage densities. For the intra-rater agreement, Weighted Kappa for Wolfe scale was 0.87 (P < 0.0001) and for Boyd scale was 0.86 (P < 0.0001). The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.96 for percentage densities. The study concludes that both visual qualitative and quantitative measurements on mammographic density are highly reproducible in the breast cancer research studies if appropriate training is provided. The method is appropriate for risk assessment in a prevention trial.\n",

      "<TITLE> Habituation Learning Is a Widely Affected Mechanism in Drosophila Models of Intellectual Disability and Autism Spectrum Disorders\n",
      "<ABSTRACT> BackgroundAlthough habituation is one of the most ancient and fundamental forms of learning, its regulators and its relevance for human disease are poorly understood.MethodsWe manipulated the orthologs of 286 genes implicated in intellectual disability (ID) with or without comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD) specifically in Drosophila neurons, and we tested these models in light-off jump habituation. We dissected neuronal substrates underlying the identified habituation deficits and integrated genotype–phenotype annotations, gene ontologies, and interaction networks to determine the clinical features and molecular processes that are associated with habituation deficits.ResultsWe identified >100 genes required for habituation learning. For 93 of these genes, a role in habituation learning was previously unknown. These genes characterize ID disorders with macrocephaly and/or overgrowth and comorbid ASD. Moreover, individuals with ASD from the Simons Simplex Collection carrying damaging de novo mutations in these genes exhibit increased aberrant behaviors associated with inappropriate, stereotypic speech. At the molecular level, ID genes required for normal habituation are enriched in synaptic function and converge on Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras/MAPK) signaling. Both increased Ras/MAPK signaling in gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurons and decreased Ras/MAPK signaling in cholinergic neurons specifically inhibit the adaptive habituation response.ConclusionsOur work supports the relevance of habituation learning to ASD, identifies an unprecedented number of novel habituation players, supports an emerging role for inhibitory neurons in habituation, and reveals an opposing, circuit-level-based mechanism for Ras/MAPK signaling. These findings establish habituation as a possible, widely applicable functional readout and target for pharmacologic intervention in ID/ASD.\n",

      "<TITLE> Rotavirus Gastroenteritis Infection Among Children Vaccinated and Unvaccinated With Rotavirus Vaccine in Southern China\n",
      "<ABSTRACT> Since 2000, the Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccine has been exclusively licensed in China for voluntary rotavirus gastroenteritis (RV-GE) prevention.To evaluate the association of the Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccination with RV-GE among children in southern China.This cross-sectional, ecological study was set in Guangzhou, China. Participants were infants possibly vaccinated (aged 2 months to 3 years) and the children ineligible for vaccination (aged ≥4 years). The study was conducted from May 1, 2007, to April 30, 2016, and the data analysis was conducted in July 2016.Annual median age at onset of RV-GE and seasonal distribution of incidence. Cases of RV-GE in Guangzhou, China, diagnosed from May 1, 2007, to April 30, 2016, and reported to the National Information System for Disease Control and Prevention were examined. Poisson regression models were fitted among 32 452 children younger than 4 years and among 450 children who had been ineligible for vaccination, while controlling for secular trends, socioeconomic status, and meteorological factors. Logistic regression was used to assess the indirect effects provided by the vaccinated infants from 2009 to 2011 on unvaccinated infants aged 2 to 35 months based on a separate case-control data set.During 9 seasons, 119 705 patients with gastroenteritis were reported; 33 407 were confirmed for RV-GE (21 202 [63.5%] male, 32 022 [95.8%] aged <4 years, and 31 306 [93.8%] residing in urban districts). The median age at onset for all patients with RV-GE increased from 11 months during the 2007 season to 15 months during the 2015 season, and the onset, peak, and cessation of incidence were delayed. When citywide vaccination coverage in the prior 12 months was classified into high and low groups (≥8.36% vs <8.36%), the incidence rate ratio for the high coverage group decreased by 32.4% among children younger than 4 years (incidence rate ratio, 0.676; 95% CI, 0.659-0.693; P < .001). Among the children ineligible for vaccination, the incidence rate ratio in higher coverage periods was 0.790 (95% CI, 0.351-0.915; P < .001) compared with the lower coverage. Compared with districts with 14% or less vaccination coverage, the adjusted odds ratio for RV-GE among unvaccinated children younger than 3 years was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73-0.99; P = .03) for districts with 15% to 19% of coverage, and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67-0.93; P = .004) for districts with more than 20% of coverage.This study provides evidence of the population health benefits of the Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccination in preventing RV-GE among children in China younger than 4 years, including herd effects.\n",

Polycrystalline thin films of Sn1−xYbxTe were deposited onto clean glass substrates by using vacuum evaporation technique at 10−6 bar. The structures of the polycrystalline thin films were examined by X-ray diffraction patterns. A rock salt structure was observed. Grain size increased with increasing Yb content but not according to a sequence. The morphology of the nanosheet structures for these thin films was determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy. TE properties were measured at a temperature range of 298–523 K. The carrier concentrations of the films were determined by Hall effect measurements at 300 K.\n",

J .Soil .Nature. 2(1): 30-33 A pot experiment was carried out at the net house of Soil Science Division, BARI, Joydebpur, Gazipur during rabi season of 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 to find out the response of inoculation with different plant genotypes of gardenpea. Three varieties of gardenpea viz. BARI Motorshuti-1, BARI Motorshuti-2, BARI Motorshuti-3 and rhizobial inoculum (BARI RPs-502) were used in this experiment. Each variety was tested with and without inoculation. Inoculated plants gave significantly higher nodule number, nodule weight, root weight, shoot weight, stover yield and seed yield compared to non-inoculated plants. Among the three varieties, BARI Motorshuti-1 produced the highest yield in both the years. The seed yield of variety BARI Motorshuti-1 were 35% and 31% higher for inoculated plants compared to uninoculated ones for the years 2005-06 and 2006-07,\n",

      "<TITLE> Novel, Potentially Zoonotic Paramyxoviruses from the African Straw-Colored Fruit Bat Eidolon helvum\n",
      "<ABSTRACT> ABSTRACT Bats carry a variety of paramyxoviruses that impact human and domestic animal health when spillover occurs. Recent studies have shown a great diversity of paramyxoviruses in an urban-roosting population of straw-colored fruit bats in Ghana. Here, we investigate this further through virus isolation and describe two novel rubulaviruses: Achimota virus 1 (AchPV1) and Achimota virus 2 (AchPV2). The viruses form a phylogenetic cluster with each other and other bat-derived rubulaviruses, such as Tuhoko viruses, Menangle virus, and Tioman virus. We developed AchPV1- and AchPV2-specific serological assays and found evidence of infection with both viruses in Eidolon helvum across sub-Saharan Africa and on islands in the Gulf of Guinea. Longitudinal sampling of E. helvum indicates virus persistence within fruit bat populations and suggests spread of AchPVs via horizontal transmission. We also detected possible serological evidence of human infection with AchPV2 in Ghana and Tanzania. It is likely that clinically significant zoonotic spillover of chiropteran paramyxoviruses could be missed throughout much of Africa where health surveillance and diagnostics are poor and comorbidities, such as infection with HIV or Plasmodium sp., are common.\n",

      "<TITLE> Inducible expression of AML1-ETO fusion protein endows leukemic cells with susceptibility to extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis\n",
      "<ABSTRACT> AML1-ETO, a leukemia-associated fusion protein generated by the frequently occurred chromosome translocation t(8;21) in acute myeloid leukemia, was shown to exert dichotomous functions in leukemic cells, that is, growth arrest versus differentiation block. By the analysis of oligonucleotide microarray, AML1-ETO was shown to modulate the expressions of an impressive array of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes. Here, we investigate potential effects of the ecdysone inducible AML1-ETO expression on apoptosis of leukemic U937 cell line. We show that AML1-ETO significantly stabilizes death receptor Fas protein and increases proapoptotic Bak in addition to reducing Bcl-2 expression. Accordingly, inducible AML1-ETO expression is followed by apoptosis to a lower degree. Especially, AML1-ETO endows leukemic cells with the susceptibility to anti-Fas agonist antibody, ultraviolet light and camptothecin analog NSC606985-induced apoptosis with increased activation of caspase-3/8. Considering that apoptosis-enhancing effect of AML1-ETO would not be favorable to the leukemogenesis harboring the t(8;21) translocation, it must be overcome to fulfill their leukemogenic potential. Complementary to this prediction is that two AML1-ETO-carrying leukemic cells, Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1, present similar sensitivity to apoptosis induction with AML1-ETO-negative leukemic cells. Therefore, genetic and/or epigenetic screenings of apoptosis-related genes modulated by AML1-ETO deserve to be explored for understanding the mechanisms of AML1-ETO-induced leukemogenesis.\n",

      "<TITLE> Modelling of Virtual Production Networks\n",
      "<ABSTRACT> Nowadays many companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), specialize in a limite d field of production. It requires forming virtual pr oduction networks of cooperating enterprises to man ufacture better, faster and cheaper. Apart from that, some production order s cannot be realized, because there is not a compan y of sufficient production potential. In this case the virtual prod uction networks of cooperating companies can realiz e these production orders. These networks have larger production capac ity and many different resources. Therefore it can realize many more production orders together than each of them separa tely. Such organization allows for executing high q uality product. The maintenance costs of production capacity and used r esources are not so high. In this paper a methodology of rapid prototyping of virtual production networks is proposed. It allows to execute production orders on time considered existing logistic constra ints.\n",

    " 'abstract': \"Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.\"}"
